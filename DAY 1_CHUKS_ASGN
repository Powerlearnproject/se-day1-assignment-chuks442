1) Software engineering is the systematic process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining software applications. It's crucial in the tech industry as it drives innovation, powers businesses, improves lives, boosts the economy, and helps solve complex global challenges.
2)(a) The Software Crisis
Initially, software development was largely seen as an art form. As software systems grew in complexity, however, issues like cost overruns, project failures, and unreliable software became increasingly prevalent. This period, known as the "software crisis," prompted the need for a more structured approach to software development, giving birth to the field of software engineering.

b)The Rise of Methodologies
To address the challenges of the software crisis, various methodologies emerged. Structured programming, for instance, introduced a disciplined approach to coding, making software more readable and maintainable. Later, object-oriented programming revolutionized software development by modeling real-world entities as objects, enhancing code reusability and flexibility.

c)Agile Development
Recognizing the need for adaptability in a rapidly changing environment, Agile methodologies gained prominence. This approach emphasized iterative development, collaboration, and customer feedback, leading to more responsive and user-centric software products.

These milestones represent significant steps in the evolution of software engineering, transforming it from a chaotic craft into a disciplined engineering discipline.
